# my-linux-setup
my linuxos(ubuntu) set up after installing.

As I am new to ubuntu of linux system, some time making note will be easy to setup next time.

1. first thing when setting of a ubuntu system during installation time set an easy password for using sudo privilage. That password need every time we install sudo command and installing some software.
2. Then connect to internet update and connect to ubuntu repository using $ sudo apt update (then we can use apt to download some software).
3. Then download your favorite web browser(google chrome).
   1. Use wget to download google chrome latest .deb file ($ wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb)
   2. Use sudo to install google chrome (needed password use easier one) ($ sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb)
   3. It's done.
4. As a not expert web developer a good easy code editor will be good (vim is not my thing). VS code my choice of code editor.
5. A good version control will be helpful of any software developer. Git is my choice and must popular.
